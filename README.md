# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, solved in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each Advent of Code challenge day. Inside each folder, you will find:

- `day-X.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code and explanations for the solutions to the challenges of day X.
- `day-X.txt`: Input data necessary for solving the challenges of day X.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions and code, simply navigate to the respective day's folder and open the `day-X.ipynb` notebook.

### Prerequisites

To run the notebooks locally, you'll need:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Running the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
